[assembly: AssemblyDescription("In this study, an image processing-based method has been developed to automatically segment the petiole region of plant leaves. To determine the boundary line of the petiole region, the cumulative pixel distributions of the input images, in binary format, are analyzed according to the X- and Y-axes. Consequently, optimal thresholds and petiole boundary points are determined. \nYou can access the article for this application at the following address: https://doi.org/10.1177/0020294020917701 Elen, A., & Avuçlu, E.
